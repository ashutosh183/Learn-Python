    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define python programming language?\n",
    "A. Indentation is used to define block of code in python.\n",
    "    For Ex: a=20\n",
    "    If a>10:\n",
    "    Print(“a is greater than 10”)\n",
    "    else :\n",
    "    print(“a is less than 10”)\n",
    "    In this above example to define indentation for if block we used tab space or 4 spaces .\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in python?\n",
    "        A. # character is used to give single-line comments in python.\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "        A. The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime ,using a construct called? \n",
    "        A. Lambda\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "        A. PIP - Preferred Installer Program, it is a command-line utility that installs, reinstalls, or uninstalls PyPI packages .\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "        A. print(),type(),id(),sum(),max(),min(),len() are few built-in functions in python.\n",

    "        A. Python is simple to use and understand , dynamically typed , Free and open source, portability etc\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "        A. Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "15. How to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "       A. Open the official Python website in your web browser. And download the latest python version\n",
    "        Run the Executable installer.\n",
    "        Add Python to PATH environmental variables\n",
    "        To verify the python installation through the command line. Open command prompt and type “python”.\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "       A. Indentation is mandatory in python to define the blocks of statements. The number of spaces must be uniform in a block of code. It is preferred to use whitespaces instead of tabs to indent in python.\n"
